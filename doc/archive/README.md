# Archive

Historical documentation and migration plans for reference.

## 📚 Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

### Migration & Planning Documents
- **[Architecture Migration Plan](ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)** - Plan for migrating from `curobo_gen_traj` to `unified_planner` (November 2025)
- **[MPC Documentation Changelog](MPC_DOCUMENTATION_CHANGELOG.md)** - Changelog for MPC documentation updates (November 2025)

## 🎯 Purpose of Archives

These documents serve several purposes:

1. **Historical Reference**: Track how the system evolved over time
2. **Migration Context**: Understand why certain design decisions were made
3. **Learning Resource**: See the thought process behind architectural changes
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain documentation of major changes

## 📖 When to Archive Documents

Documents are moved to archive when:
- They describe completed migrations or transitions
- They contain temporary planning information
- They are superseded by updated documentation
- They serve primarily historical rather than practical value
